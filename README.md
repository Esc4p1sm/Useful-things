Hello!
There are some solutions here that I couldn't find on the internet. 
I tried to achieve the scrollbox effect as in the picture and even came close to it.

You can take this code and improve it/change it to suit your needs. Of course, to achieve this effect, you will have to work a little on the design itself. :)
I also added a feature that will allow you to change the navigation in widgets to WASD. I will continue to add something useful in my opinion, I apologize if the quality of the code is terrible.
If you don't know how to add this to your project, then you just need to copy the files to the folder with your project (your project should be based on c++), then click on .uproject in the folder with your project and generate files for Visual Studio. Then inherit your widget from my class. Good luck!
